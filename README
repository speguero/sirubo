                                 SIRUBO

      ASN prefix (big tech conglomerate) outbound traffic blocker.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYNOPSIS
========

sirubo [-c] [-f] [-r] [-s]

  -c    Create firewall ruleset and ruleset persistency service.

  -f    Show cached firewall ruleset.

  -r    Resume enforcement of cached firewall ruleset and enable ruleset
        persistency service.

  -s    Disable cached firewall ruleset and ruleset persistency service.


DESCRIPTION
===========

The sirubo utility is a POSIX shell script that makes use of:

  - nftables on Linux and pf on OpenBSD, to facilitate the rejection of
    outgoing traffic to prefixes (subnets) associated with autonomous
    system networks (ASNs) that you, the user, specify.

  - whois, to perform a query for ASN prefixes (subnets).


MOTIVE
======

Preventing passive and nonconsensual telemetry, and the infringement of
one's privacy thereafter, from impertinently inquisitive big tech
conglomerates, such as Facebook and Alphabet (Google).


NAME ORIGIN
===========

Dissecting the etymology of sirubo (pronounced as seer-rue-bow), "si"
refers to the silicon chemical symbol (Si), which is in reference to
Silicon Valley. "rubo" is a word of the universal auxiliary language of
Esperanto, meaning "trash" or "garbage".


REQUIREMENTS
============

OpenBSD | Linux
------- | -----
pf      | nftables
whois   | whois
        | systemd


INSTALL
=======

1) Install sirubo and create a configuration file:

% sudo make

2) To illustrate, add the following two lines of ASNs to
   "/usr/local/etc/sirubo.conf":

AS15169 # Facebook
AS32934 # Google

3) Generate a new firewall ruleset:

% sirubo create

   Upon this command, a service will also be created, enabling ruleset
   persistency and automatic ruleset updates upon system reboots.

4) Test your new firewall ruleset. Attempt to open a TCP connection with
   a domain name or IP address associated with a specified ASN:

% nc -vw 1 google.com 443

   Which should print output such as this:

> nc: connect to google.com (0.0.0.0) port 443 (tcp) failed: Connection
> refused

   This will indicate that your firewall is configured to reject
   outbound traffic to google.com.


UNINSTALL
=========

1) From its repository, run the following to uninstall sirubo:

% make uninstall

   Or run the following to uninstall sirubo and delete its
   configuration file:

% make clean

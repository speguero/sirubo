SYNOPSIS
========

sirubo create|resume|show|stop

  create
      Create firewall ruleset and ruleset persistency service.

  resume
      Resume enforcement of cached firewall ruleset and enable ruleset
      persistency service.

  show
      Show cached firewall ruleset.

  stop
      Disable cached firewall ruleset and ruleset persistency service.


DESCRIPTION
===========

The sirubo utility is a POSIX shell script that makes use of:

  - Transport-layer packet filtering; in particular, nftables on Linux
    and pf on OpenBSD, to facilitate the rejection of outgoing traffic
    to autonomous system network, or ASN, prefixes (subnets).

  - whois, to perform a query for ASN prefixes (subnets).


REQUIREMENTS
============

  Linux    | OpenBSD
  -----    | -------
  nftables | pf
  whois    | whois
  systemd  |


MOTIVE
======

Preventing passive and nonconsensual telemetry, and the infringement of
one's privacy thereafter, from intrusively inquisitive big tech
conglomerates, such as Meta (Facebook) and Alphabet (Google).


NAME ORIGIN
===========

Dissecting the etymology of sirubo (pronounced as seer-rue-bow), "si"
refers to the silicon chemical symbol of "Si", referencing Silicon Valley.
The word "rubo" derives from the Esperanto language, meaning "trash".


INSTALL
=======

1) Install sirubo:

% sudo make install


2) To illustrate, add the following ASN to /usr/local/etc/sirubo.conf:

AS32934 # Google


3) Create a new firewall ruleset:

% sirubo -c


4) Test your newly created firewall ruleset:

% nc -vw 1 google.com 443

   The command should print a message similar to this:

> nc: connect to google.com (0.0.0.0) port 443 (tcp) failed: Connection
> refused

   This will indicate that your operating system firewall is configured
   to reject all outbound traffic directed at Google's ASN prefixes.


UNINSTALL
=========

1) Within this repository, uninstall sirubo:

% make uninstall

   Or, optionally, uninstall sirubo and delete its configuration files:

% make clean


FILES
=====

  Programs
  --------

  - /usr/local/bin/sirubo
        The utility itself.


  Configuration Files
  -------------------

  - /usr/local/etc/sirubo.conf
        Contains ASNs that you, the user, specify for rejection.

  - /usr/local/etc/sirubo.ruleset
        Contains a cached firewall ruleset.

  - /usr/local/etc/sirubo.ruleset.backup
        Contains a defunct firewall ruleset that is reserved as a backup
        when creating a new ruleset manually or automatically.


  Services
  --------

  - /etc/systemd/system/sirubo.service (Linux)
        A service that facilitates firewall ruleset persistency and
        automatic ruleset updates with every operating system reboot.

  - /etc/rc.d/sirubo (OpenBSD)
        A service that facilitates firewall ruleset persistency and
        automatic ruleset updates with every operating system reboot.
